# Pomodoro-Clock
 A Pomodoro clock helps break down work into intervals. Traditionally there are work periods of 25 min and short breaks in between.
 The purpose of this project was to understand how to create a timer in JavaScript.  One key aspect was to be able to pause the 
 timer and be able to start it back up from where it left off.
 
## Usage
The default work time is set to 25 min and the default break time is set to 5 min. You can increase or decrease the min by
clicking '+' or '-'.

Timer can be paused at any time by clicking 'Pause'; clicking on 'Resume' will resume the timer.

A message of 'Break' will be displayed when the user is supposed to be taking a break from work.
